<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">F</span>ROM a purely practical point of view the most
important of the relations of native birds to
man are the economic. The esthetic value of birds
is great&mdash;greater, indeed, than that of any other
group of animals; and that this is a real and especially
treasured value is not to be denied. But it
is in their relation to insect and other enemies of
crops that birds are most directly associated with
the welfare of mankind, and their value in this particular
should be made as widely known as possible.</p>

<p>This bulletin is one of a series designed to assist
in doing this. Not all birds are beneficial, and all
facts tending to show in which class each species
belongs will be set forth. The useful kinds far outnumber
the injurious, however, and so great is their
value as insect destroyers in the United States that
to them may be given the credit of being one of
the greatest controlling factors in limiting the development
of insect pests and in preventing many
disastrous outbreaks.</p>

<p>In the following pages are discussed the habitat,
food habits, and relation to agriculture of more than
50 species of birds common to farming sections.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">W</span>HETHER a bird is beneficial or injurious depends almost
entirely upon what it eats. In the case of species which are
very abundant, or which feed to some extent on the crops of
the farmer, the question of their average diet becomes one of supreme
importance, and only by stomach examinations can it be satisfactorily
answered. Field observations are at best but fragmentary and
inconclusive and lead to no final results. Birds are often accused
of eating this or that product of cultivation, when an examination
of the stomachs shows the accusation to be unfounded. Accordingly,
the Biological Survey has conducted for some years a systematic
investigation of the food of those species which are most common
about the farm and garden.</p>

<p>Within certain limits birds eat the kind of food that is most
accessible, especially when their natural food is scarce or wanting.
Thus they sometimes injure the crops of the farmer who has unintentionally
destroyed their natural food in his improvement of
swamp or pasture. Most of the damage done by birds and complained
of by farmers and fruit growers arises from this very cause,
the berry-producing shrubs and seed-bearing weeds have been cleared
away, and the birds have no recourse but to attack the cultivated
grain or fruit which has replaced their natural food supply. The
great majority of land birds subsist upon insects during the period
of nesting and molting, and also feed their young upon them during
the first few weeks. Many species live almost entirely upon insects,
taking vegetable food only when other subsistence fails. It is thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">« 2 »</a></span>
evident that in the course of a year birds destroy an incalculable
number of insects, and it is difficult to overestimate the value of their
services in restraining the great tide of insect life.</p>

<p>In winter, in the northern part of the country, insects become
scarce or entirely disappear. Many species of birds, however, remain
during the cold season and are able to maintain life by eating vegetable
food, as the seeds of weeds. Here again is another useful function
of birds in destroying these weed seeds and thereby lessening
the growth of the next year.</p>

<p>In the following pages are discussed the food habits of more than
50 birds belonging to 12 families. Many are eastern forms which
are represented in the West by slightly different species or subspecies,
but unless the food habits differ they are not separately
described. In some cases specific percentages of food are given,
but for the most part the statements are made without direct reference
to the data on which they are based.</p>

<p>The eastern bluebird<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>), one of the most familiar and welcome of our
feathered visitors, is a common inhabitant of all the States east of the Rocky
Mountains from the Gulf of Mexico to southern Canada. In the Mississippi
valley it winters as far north as southern Illinois, and in the East as far as
Pennsylvania. It is one of the earliest northern migrants, and everywhere is
hailed as a harbinger of spring. Very domestic in habits, it frequents orchards
and gardens, and builds its nests in
cavities of trees, crannies in farm
buildings, or boxes provided for its
use.</p>

</div>

<p>The bluebird has not been accused,
so far as known, of stealing fruit or
of preying upon crops. An examination
of 855 stomachs showed that 68
per cent of the food consists of insects
and their allies, while the other
32 per cent is made up of various
vegetable substances, found mostly in
stomachs taken in winter. Beetles
constitute 21 per cent of the whole
food, grasshoppers 22, caterpillars 10,
and various other insects 9, while a
number of spiders and myriapods,
about 6 per cent, comprise the remainder
of the animal diet. All
these are more or less harmful, except
a few predacious beetles, which amount to 9 per cent. In view of the large
consumption of grasshoppers and caterpillars, we may at least condone this
offense, if such it may be called. The destruction of grasshoppers is very
noticeable in August and September, when these insects make up about 53 per
cent of the diet.</p>

<p>It is evident that in the selection of its food the bluebird is governed more
by abundance than by choice. Predacious beetles are eaten in spring, as they
are among the first insects to appear; but in early summer caterpillars form
an important part of the diet, and these are later replaced by grasshoppers.
Beetles are eaten at all times, except when grasshoppers are more easily
obtained.</p>

<p>So far as its vegetable food is concerned the bluebird is positively harmless.
The only trace of any useful product in the stomachs consisted of a few blackberry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span>
seeds, and even these probably belonged to wild rather than cultivated
varieties. Following is a list of the various seeds which were found; Blackberry,
chokeberry, juniperberry, pokeberry, partridgeberry, greenbrier, Virginia
creeper, bittersweet, holly, strawberry bush, false spikenard, wild sarsaparilla,
sumac (several species), rose haws, sorrel, ragweed, grass, and asparagus. This
list shows how little the bluebird depends upon the farm or garden to supply
its needs and how easily, by encouraging the growth of some of these plants,
many of which are highly ornamental, the bird may be induced to make its
home on the premises.</p>

<p>Two species of bluebirds inhabit the Western States&mdash;the mountain bluebird<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and the western bluebird.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In their food habits they are even more to be commended
than their eastern relative. Their insect food is obtainable at all
times of the year, and the general diet varies only in the fall, when some fruit,
principally elderberries, is eaten, though an occasional blackberry or grape is
also relished. In an examination of 217 stomachs of the western bluebird, animal
matter (insects and spiders) was found to the extent of 82 per cent and
vegetable matter to the extent of 18 per cent. The bulk of the former consists
of bugs, grasshoppers, and caterpillars. Grasshoppers, when they can be obtained,
are eaten freely during the whole season. Caterpillars also are a
favorite food and are eaten during every month of the year; March is the month
of greatest consumption, with 50 per cent, and the average for the year is 20
per cent. Two stomachs taken in January contained 64 and 50 per cent, respectively,
of caterpillars. Beetles also
are eaten and comprise mostly
harmful species.</p>

<p>The vegetable matter consists of
weed seeds and small fruits. In
December a few grapes are eaten,
but elderberries are the favorites
whenever they can be found. It is
only when these are in their greatest
abundance that vegetable exceeds
animal food.</p>

<p>The robin<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>), in many parts
of the country one of the most cherished
of our birds, is found throughout the States east of the Great Plains, and is
represented farther west and south by slightly different subspecies.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, <a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It
breeds far north through Canada, and is found even in Alaska. Although the
great bulk of the species leaves the Northern States in winter, a few individuals
remain in sheltered swamps, where wild berries furnish abundant food. The
robin is an omnivorous feeder and its food habits have sometimes caused apprehension
to the fruit grower, for it is fond of cherries and other small fruits,
particularly the earlier varieties. For this reason many complaints have been
lodged against robins, and it has been necessary to permit the killing of the
birds in some fruit-growing regions.</p>

<p>Examinations of 1,236 stomachs show that 42 per cent of its food is animal
matter, principally insects, while the remainder is made up largely of small
fruits or berries. Over 16 per cent consists of beetles, about one-third of which
are useful ground beetles, taken mostly in spring and fall when other insects
are scarce. Grasshoppers make up about 5 per cent of the whole food, but in
August they comprise 17 per cent. Caterpillars form about 9 per cent, while
the rest of the animal food, about 11 per cent, is made up of various insects,
with a few spiders, snails, and angleworms. All the grasshoppers, caterpillars,
and bugs, with a large portion of the beetles, are injurious, and it is safe to
say that noxious insects comprise more than one-third of the robin&rsquo;s food.</p>

<p>Vegetable food forms 58 per cent of the stomach contents, over 42 per cent
being wild fruits and only a little more than 8 per cent being possibly cultivated
varieties. Cultivated fruit amounting to about 25 per cent was found in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span>
the stomachs in June and July, but only a trifle in August. Wild fruit, on the
contrary, is eaten every month and constitutes a staple food during half the
year. No less than 65 species of fruit were identified in the stomachs; of these,
the most important were 4 species of dogwood, 3 of wild cherries, 3 of wild
grapes, 4 of greenbrier, 2 of holly, 2 of elder; and cranberries, huckleberries,
blueberries, barberries, service berries, hackberries, and persimmons; together
with 4 species of sumac and various other seeds not strictly fruit.</p>

<p>The depredations of the robin seem to be confined to the smaller and earlier
fruits, few, if any, complaints being made that it eats apples, peaches, pears,
grapes, or even late cherries. By the time these are ripe the forests and hedges
are teeming with wild fruits which the bird evidently finds more to its taste.
The cherry, unfortunately for man, ripens so early that it is almost the only
fruit accessible at a time when the bird&rsquo;s appetite has been sharpened by a
long-continued diet of insects, earthworms, and dried berries, and it is no
wonder that at first the rich juicy morsels are greedily eaten.</p>

<p>While the robin takes some cultivated fruits, it must be remembered that,
being a natural enemy of the insect world, it has been working during the
whole season to make that crop a possibility, and when the fruit ripens the
robin already has a standing account with the farmer for services rendered,
with the credits up to this time entirely on his side.</p>

<p>Much has been written about the delicate discrimination of birds for choice
fruit and their selection of only the finest and costliest varieties. This is contrary
to observed facts. Birds, unlike human beings, seem to prefer fruit that,
like the mulberry, is sweetly insipid, or that, like the chokecherry or holly, has
some astringent or bitter quality. The so-called black alder, a species of holly,
has bright scarlet berries tasting as bitter as quinine, that ripen late in October
and remain on the bushes through November. Though frost grapes, the fruit
of the Virginia creeper, and several species of dogwood are abundant at the
same time, the birds have been found to eat the berries of the holly to a considerable
extent. It is, moreover, a remarkable fact that the wild fruits upon
which birds largely feed are those which man neither gathers for his own use
nor adopts for cultivation.</p>

<p>Where wild fruit is not abundant, a few fruit-bearing shrubs and vines
judiciously planted will serve for ornament and provide food for the birds.
The Russian mulberry is a vigorous grower and a profuse bearer, ripening at
the same time as the cherry. So far as observation has gone, most birds seem
to prefer its fruit to any other. It is believed that a number of mulberry trees
planted around the garden or orchard would fully protect the more valuable
fruits.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="THE_TITMICE" id="THE_TITMICE">THE TITMICE.</a></p>


<p>Birds of the titmouse family, though insignificant in size, are far from being
so in the matter of food habits. What they lack in size of body they more than
make up in numbers of individuals. While in the case of some larger birds, as,
for instance, the flicker, there is one pair of eyes to look for food for one large
stomach, we have in the case of the ten times as numerous titmice an equivalent
stomach capacity divided into 10 parts, each furnished with a pair of eyes and
other accessories, as wings and feet. As against the one place occupied by the
larger bird, 10 are being searched for food at the same time by the smaller
species.</p>

<p>The character of the food of titmice gives a peculiar value to their services,
for it consists largely of the small insects and their eggs that wholly escape the
search of larger birds. Throughout the year most of the species of this group
remain on their range, so that they are constantly engaged in their beneficial
work, continuing it in winter when the majority of their coworkers have
sought a milder clime. It is at this season that the titmice do their greatest
good, for when flying and crawling insects are no more to be found, the birds
must feed upon such species as they find hibernating in crevices, or upon the
eggs of insects laid in similar places. In winter&rsquo;s dearth of moving insects the
search for such animal food as may be found is perforce thorough and
unremitting.</p>

<p>Within the boundaries of the United States are some 17 species of titmice,
with nearly as many races or subspecies, so that there is no portion of the
country lacking one or more forms. The western coast region is peculiarly rich
In representatives of the family. In the eastern portion of the country the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span>
best-known and most widely distributed species is the common black-capped
chickadee<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>). This bird, or some of its subspecies, occupies the whole of
that part of the United States north of the latitude of Washington and extends
into Canada. It is a prolific breeder, usually rearing from six to eight young
in a brood.</p>

</div>

<p>Examination of 289 stomachs of this chickadee shows that its food consists of
68 per cent animal matter (insects) and 32 per cent vegetable matter. The
former is made up of small caterpillars and moths and their eggs. Prominent
among the latter are the eggs of the tent caterpillar moths, both the orchard
and forest species. As these are two of our most destructive insects, the good
done by the chickadee in devouring their eggs needs no comment. During the
winter the chickadee&rsquo;s food is made up of larvæ, chrysalids, and eggs of moths,
varied by a few seeds, but as spring brings out hordes of flying, crawling, and
jumping insects, the bird varies its diet by taking also some of these. Flies and
bugs are the favorites until the weather becomes quite warm, when beetles and
small wasps also are enjoyed. Among the bugs may be mentioned the plant
lice and their eggs which are eaten
in winter. The beetles nearly all belong
to the group of snout beetles,
more commonly known as weevils.
These insects are mostly of small
size, and nearly all are known to the
farmer or fruit raiser as pests. Seventeen
of them were found in one
stomach. Grasshoppers do not at any
time constitute an important element
of the food of the chickadee, as they
are too large for so small a bird;
moreover, they are for the most part
terrestrial Insects, while the bird is
essentially arboreal. Small wasps
and ants are eaten to some extent
Spiders constitute an Important element
of the food and are eaten at all
times of the year, the birds locating
them when they are hibernating in
winter, as well as when they are active
in summer. The vegetable food
of the chickadee consists largely of
small seeds, except in summer, when
they are replaced by pulp of wild
fruit. The wax from the seeds of
poison ivy Is eaten during the winter months, but the seeds themselves are not
taken. In this respect the chickadee differs from most other birds, which swallow
the seeds whole; these, after digesting the wax, pass the seeds through the
alimentary canal, or regurgitate them, and so scatter them broadcast to reproduce
the noxious plants.</p>

<p>In the southern part of the country the Carolina chickadee<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and the tufted
tit<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> replace the black-cap, but their food habits are so similar that there is
practically no difference in the work done. In the West several other species
occur; one of the most interesting is the bush tit<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which, with several subspecies,
occupies the whole Pacific coast region. They are active, social little
creatures, and except for a short time during the breeding season are found in
flocks, flitting from tree to tree, busily hunting for Insects and their eggs. The
contents of 66 stomachs of these birds were found to consist mostly of injurious
insects to the extent of 83 per cent. Of these the most important was a small
hemipterous insect which amounted to more than half of the stomach contents.
These insects are of considerable economic importance, as they frequently
infest grapevines and other plants to a harmful extent Several stomachs were
almost exclusively filled with these minute creatures, some containing as many
as 100 individuals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span></p></div>

<p>Perhaps the most important and interesting insect found was the black olive
scale, which occurred in 24 stomachs and amounted to a little more than 18
per cent of the food. In addition, a number of the stomachs were more or less
filled with another scale, which was not further identified. A number of small
snout beetles (weevils) were eaten and some small caterpillars; there were also
the remains of a spider.</p>

<p>The vegetable food of the species seemed to consist mostly of seeds, but they
were so broken up as to defy recognition. A little fruit pulp and a little mast
were also found.</p>

<p>Among the stomachs of the bush tits examined were those of one brood of
eight nestlings about 10 days old. The vegetable matter in these stomachs was
only three-fourths of 1 per cent and consisted of one seed and some rubbish.
The animal matter was made up of beetles, wasps, bugs, caterpillars and pupæ,
and spiders. The greatest interest lies in the fact that every one of these stomachs
contained pupæ of the codling moth, on an average of over five to each.
The oak tree in which these birds were found was in a belt of timber near a
neglected orchard which the parent birds used as a foraging ground, and they
did their best to remedy the neglect of the owner. As feeding and digestion
in the case of nestling birds is almost continuous during the hours of daylight,
the above record would be several times repeated during a day&rsquo;s feeding. There
were probably not less than a
dozen nests of the bush tit along
the border of this orchard, and
these birds must have exerted a
great restrictive influence upon the
increase of the codling moth, as
well as of other insects in that
vicinity.</p>

(<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>) frequents barns and gardens,
and particularly old orchards
in which the trees are partially
decayed. He makes his nest in a
hollow where perhaps a woodpecker
had a domicile the year
before, but he is a pugnacious character,
and if he happens to fancy
one of the boxes put up for bluebirds,
he does not hesitate to take it He is usually not slow to avail himself
of boxes, gourds, tin cans, or empty jars placed for his accommodation.</p>

<p>In food habits the house wren is entirely beneficial. He may be said to
live upon animal food alone, for an examination of 88 stomachs showed that
98 per cent of the contents was made up of insects or their allies, and only 2
per cent was vegetable food, including bits of grass and similar matter, evidently
taken by accident with the insects. Half of this food consisted of
grasshoppers and beetles; the remainder of caterpillars, bugs, and spiders.
As the wren is a prolific breeder, frequently rearing in a season from 12 to 16
young, a family of these birds must cause considerable reduction in the number
of insects in a garden. Wrens are industrious foragers, searching every tree,
shrub, and vine for caterpillars, and examining every post and rail of the fence
and every cranny in the wall for insects or spiders.</p>

<p>The house wren is only one of a numerous group of small birds of similar
habits. There are within the limits of the United States 28 species and subspecies
of wrens, occupying more or less completely the whole country from
the Atlantic to the Pacific. With the exception of the marsh wrens,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> they all
appear to prefer some cosy nook for a nesting site, and, as it happens, the
farm buildings afford just the place desired. This has led several of the wrens
to seek out the habitations of man, and he is benefited by their destruction of
noxious insects. Wrens have rarely been accused of harm, and their presence
should be encouraged except when undue interference with the nests of other
birds is noted.</p>

Great Plains, and winters in the South Atlantic and Gulf States. It visits
the garden or orchard, its nest, however, being in dense shrubbery or groves.
The thrasher&rsquo;s favorite time for singing is in early morning, when, perched
on the top of a bush or tree, it gives an exhibition of vocal powers which
would do credit to the mockingbird.
Indeed, in the South, where the latter
bird is abundant, the thrasher is
known as the sandy mocker.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;Brown thrasher. Length, about 11 inches.</div>
</div>

<p>The food of the brown thrasher
consists of both fruit and insects.
An examination of 636 stomachs
showed 59 per cent of vegetable and
41 per cent of animal food, practically
all insects, and mostly taken in
spring before fruit was ripe. Half
the insects were beetles and the remainder
chiefly grasshoppers, caterpillars,
bugs, and spiders. A few
predacious beetles were eaten, but on
the whole the work of the species as
an insect destroyer may be considered beneficial.</p>

<p>Eight per cent of its food is made up of fruits like raspberries and currants
which are or may be cultivated, but the raspberries at least are as likely to
belong to wild as to cultivated varieties. Grain, made up mostly of scattered
kernels of oats and corn, is merely a trifle, amounting to only 3 per cent.
Though some of the corn may be taken from newly planted fields, it is amply
paid for by the destruction of May beetles which are eaten at the same time.
The rest of the food consists of wild fruit or seeds. Taken all in all, the brown
thrasher is a useful bird, and probably does as good work in its secluded
retreats as it would about the garden, for the swamps and groves are no doubt
the breeding grounds of many insects
that migrate thence to attack
the crops of the farmer.</p>

thrasher, is a lover of thickets and
delights to make its home in a tangle
of wild grapevines, greenbriers, and
shrubs, where it is safe from attack
and can find its favorite food in
abundance. It is found throughout
the United States west to the Rocky
Mountains, and extends also from
Washington, Idaho, and Utah northward
into the Provinces of Canada.
It winters in the Southern States,
Cuba, Mexico, and Central America.</p>

<p>Reports from the Mississippi Valley indicate that the catbird is sometimes a
serious annoyance to fruit growers. The reason for such reports may possibly
be found in the fact that on the prairies fruit-bearing shrubs, which afford so
large a part of this bird&rsquo;s food, are conspicuously absent With the settlement
of this region comes an extensive planting of orchards, vineyards, and small-fruit
gardens, which furnish shelter and nesting sites for the catbird as well
as for other species. There is in consequence a large increase in the numbers
of the birds, but no corresponding gain in the supply of native fruits upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
which they were accustomed to feed. Under these circumstances what is more
natural than for the birds to turn to cultivated fruit for their food. The
remedy is obvious: Cultivated fruits can be protected by the simple expedient
of planting the wild species which are preferred by the birds. Some experiments
with catbirds in captivity show that the Russian mulberry is preferred
to any cultivated fruit.</p>

<p>The stomachs of 645 catbirds were examined and found to contain 44 per
cent of animal (insect) and 56 per cent of vegetable food. Ants, beetles, caterpillars,
and grasshoppers constitute three-fourths of the animal food, the remainder
being made up of bugs, miscellaneous insects, and spiders. One-third
of the vegetable food consists of cultivated fruits, or those which may be
cultivated, as strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries; but while we debit
the bird with the whole of this, it is probable&mdash;and in the eastern and well-wooded
part of the country almost certain&mdash;that a large part is obtained from
wild vines. The rest of the vegetable matter is mostly wild fruit, as cherries,
dogwood, sour gum, elderberries, greenbrier, spiceberries, black alder, sumac,
and poison ivy. Although the catbird sometimes does considerable harm by
destroying small fruit, it can not on the whole be considered injurious. On
the contrary, in most parts of the
country it does far more good than
harm.</p>

<p>Seven common species of swallows
are found within the limits of
the United States, four of which
have abandoned to some extent their
primitive nesting habits and have
attached themselves to the abodes
of man.</p>

<p>In the eastern part of the country
the barn swallow<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>) now
builds exclusively under roofs, having
entirely abandoned the rock
caves and cliffs in which it formerly
nested. More recently the
cliff swallow<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> has found a better
nesting site under the eaves of
buildings than was afforded by the
overhanging cliffs of earth or stone
which it once used and to which it
still resorts occasionally in the East and habitually in the unsettled West. The
martin<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and the white-bellied, or tree, swallow<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> nest either in houses supplied
for the purpose, in abandoned nests of woodpeckers, or in natural crannies
in rocks. The northern violet-green swallow,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the rough-winged swallow,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and

<p>Field observation convinces an ordinarily attentive person that the food of
swallows must consist of the smaller insects captured in mid-air or picked from
the tops of tall grass or weeds. This observation is borne out by an examination
of stomachs, which shows that the food is made up of many small species
of beetles which are much on the wing; many species of flies, together with
large quantities of flying ants; and a few insects of similar kinds. Most of
these are either injurious or annoying, and the numbers destroyed by swallows
are not only beyond calculation but almost beyond imagination.</p>

<p>Unlike many other groups of birds, the six species of swallows found in the
Eastern States extend in a practically unchanged form across the continent,
where they are reinforced by the northern, or Pacific-coast, violet-green swallow.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to tear down from the eaves of a barn the nests of a colony of
cliff swallows, for so far from disfiguring a building they make a picturesque
addition to it, and the presence of swallows should be encouraged by every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">« 9 »</a></span>
device. It is said that cliff and barn swallows may be induced to build their
nests in a particular locality, otherwise suitable, by providing a quantity of
mud to be used by them as mortar. Barn swallows may also be encouraged by
cutting a small hole in the gable of the barn, while martins and white-bellied
swallows will be grateful for boxes like those for the bluebird, but placed in a
higher situation.</p>

<p>The towhee, chewink, or ground robin<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>), as it is variously known,
inhabits nearly the whole of the United States east of the Great Plains. It
breeds from the Middle States northward and winters in the southern half of
the country. Naturally associated with the catbird and brown thrasher, it
lives in much the same places, though it is more given to haunting hedgerows
along roads and fences. After snow has disappeared in early spring an investigation
of the rustling so often
heard among the leaves near a
fence or in a thicket will frequently
disclose a towhee hard at
work scratching for his dinner
after the manner of a hen; and
in these places and along the sunny
border of woods old leaves will be
found overturned where the bird
has been searching for hibernating
beetles and larvæ. The good which
the towhee does in this way can
hardly be overestimated, since the
death of a single insect at this
time, before it has had an opportunity
to deposit its eggs, is equivalent
to the destruction of a host
later in the year. The towhee has also been credited with visiting potato
fields and feeding upon the potato beetle. Its vegetable food consists
of seeds and small wild fruits, but no complaint on this score is known
to have been made. So for as observation goes, the bird never touches either
cultivated fruit or grain; in fact, it is too shy and retiring even to stay about
gardens for any length of time.</p>

or house, sparrow (<i>Passer domesticus</i>), including its introduction, habits, and depredations,
was published In Bull. No. 1 of the Division of Ornithology in 1889. For information
in regard to combating the English sparrow, see U. S. Department of Agriculture
Leaflet 61, English Sparrow Control.</p></div>



<p>Sparrows are not obtrusive birds, either in plumage, song, or action. There
are some 40 species, with nearly as many subspecies, in North America. Not
more than half a dozen forms are generally known in any one locality. All the
species are more or less migratory, but so widely are they distributed that there
is probably no part of the country where some can not be found throughout the
year.</p>

<p>While sparrows are noted seed eaters, they do not by any means confine
themselves to a vegetable diet. During the summer, and especially in the
breeding season, they eat many insects and feed their young largely upon the
same food. Examination of stomachs of three species&mdash;the song sparrow<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
(<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>), chipping sparrow,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and field sparrow<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> (<a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>)&mdash;shows that about one-third
of the food consists of insects, comprising many injurious beetles, as
snout beetles or weevils, and leaf beetles. Many grasshoppers are eaten. In
the case of the chipping sparrow these insects form one-eighth of the food.
Grasshoppers would seem to be rather large morsels, but the bird probably
confines itself to the smaller species; indeed, the greatest amount (over 36 per
cent) is eaten in June, when the larger species are still young and the smaller
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span>
most numerous. Besides the insects already mentioned, many wasps and bugs
are taken. Predacious and parasitic hymenopterous insects and predacious
beetles, all useful, are eaten only to a slight extent, so that as a whole the insect
diet of the native sparrows may be considered beneficial. There are several
records of potato-bug larvæ eaten by chipping sparrows.</p>

<p>Their vegetable food is limited almost
exclusively to hard seeds. This
might seem to indicate that the birds
feed to some extent upon grain, but
the stomachs examined show only one
kind, oats, and but little of that. The
great bulk of the food is made up of
grass and weed seeds, which form almost
the entire diet during winter, and
the amount consumed is immense.</p>

<p>In the agricultural region of the
upper Mississippi Valley, by roadsides,
on borders of cultivated fields, or in
abandoned fields, wherever they can obtain
a foothold, masses of rank weeds
spring up and often form almost impenetrable
thickets which afford food
and shelter for immense numbers of
birds and enable them to withstand great cold and the most terrible blizzards. A
person visiting one of these weed patches on a sunny morning in January, when
the thermometer is 20° or more below zero, will be struck with the life and
animation of the busy little inhabitants. Instead of sitting forlorn and half
frozen, they may be seen flitting from branch to branch, twittering and
fluttering, and showing every evidence of enjoyment and perfect comfort. If
one of them is captured it will be found in excellent condition; in fact, a
veritable ball of fat.</p>

<p>The snowbird<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and tree sparrow<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> are perhaps the most numerous of all the
sparrows. Examination of many stomachs shows that in winter the tree sparrow
feeds entirely upon seeds of weeds.
Probably each bird consumes about
one-fourth of an ounce a day. In an
article contributed in 1881 to the New
York Tribune the writer estimated the
amount of weed seed annually destroyed
by these birds in Iowa. On
the basis of one-fourth of an ounce
of seed eaten daily by each bird, and
an average of 10 birds to each square
mile, remaining in their winter range
200 days, there would be a total of
1,750,000 pounds, or 875 tons of weed
seed consumed in a single season by
this one species. Large as are these
figures, they unquestionably fall far
short of the reality. The estimate of
10 birds to a square mile is very conservative,
for in Massachusetts, where
the food supply is less than in the
Western States, the tree sparrow is
even more abundant than this in winter.
The writer has known places in
Iowa where several thousand tree sparrows
could be seen within the space of a
few acres. This estimate, moreover, is for a single species, while, as a matter of
fact, there are at least half a dozen birds (not all sparrows) that habitually
feed during winter on these seeds. Farther south the tree sparrow is replaced
in winter by the white-throated sparrow,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> the white-crowned sparrow,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> the fox
sparrow,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> the song sparrow, the field sparrow, and several others; so that all
over the land a vast number of these seed eaters are at work during the colder
months reducing next year&rsquo;s crop of worse than useless plants.</p>

<p>Of all the sparrow groups, there is probably no member, unless it be the
exotic form known as the English sparrow,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> that has by reason of Its food
habits called down so many maledictions upon Its head as the house finch,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
red head, or linnet, as it is variously called. This bird, like the other members
of its family, is by nature a seed eater, and before the beginning of fruit
raising in California probably subsisted upon the seeds of weeds, with an occasional
taste of some wild berry. Now, however, when orchards have extended
throughout the length and breadth of the State and every month from May to
December sees some ripening fruit, the linnets take their share. As their
number Is legion, the sum total of the fruit that they destroy is more than the
fruit raiser can well spare. As the bird has a stout beak, it has no difficulty
in breaking the skin of the hardest fruit and feasting upon the pulp, thereby
spoiling the fruit and giving weaker-billed birds a chance to sample and acquire
a taste for what they might not otherwise have molested. Complaints against
this bird have been many and loud, more especially in the years when fruit
crops first came to be an important factor in the prosperity of the Pacific coast.
At that time the various fruits afforded the linnets a new and easily obtained
food, while cultivation had reduced their formerly abundant supply of weed
seed. When the early fruit growers saw their expected golden harvest suddenly
snatched away or at least much reduced in value by the little marauders,
it is no wonder that they were exasperated and wished to destroy the authors
of the mischief.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>In order to test the matter thoroughly and ascertain whether these birds
ate any other kind of food that might to some extent offset the damage inflicted
upon the fruit, the horticulturists and ornithologists of California were requested
to secure a number of the stomachs of these birds and send them to the
Biological Survey. An agent was also sent to the fruit-raising sections, who
watched the birds in the orchards and collected a number of them. In this
way 1,206 stomachs were obtained and carefully examined, and the result shows
that animal food (insects) constituted 2.44 per cent and vegetable food 97.56
per cent of the stomach contents, not counting gravel.</p>

<p>So small a proportion of animal food can not, of course, mean a great
destruction of insects. As these stomachs were collected in every month, with
the greater number taken during the summer, it is evident that whatever good
one may expect from the linnet must not be looked for in this direction.
Unlike most of the sparrow family, the linnet does not feed its young upon
Insects to any great extent. The contents of the stomachs of a number of
nestlings were carefully examined, and the only animal food was found to
consist of wooly plant lice. These also constituted the great bulk of the
animal food eaten by adults.</p>

<p>The vegetable food of the species consists of three principal items&mdash;grain,
fruit, and weed seeds. Grain amounts to less than 1&frac12; per cent in August, which
is the month of greatest consumption, and the average for the year is a trifle
more than one-fourth of 1 per cent. Fruit attains its maximum in September,
when it amounts to 27 per cent of the whole food, but the average for the year
is only 10 per cent. The seeds of weeds constitute the bulk of the diet of the
linnet, and in August, the month of least consumption, amount to about 64
per cent of the food. The average for the year is 86 per cent.</p>

<p>From the foregoing it is evident that whatever the linnet&rsquo;s sins may be,
grain eating is not one of them. In view of the great complaint made against
its fruit-eating habits, the small quantity found in the stomachs taken is somewhat
of a surprise. But it must be remembered that the stomach contents do
not tell the whole story. When a bird takes a single peck from a cherry or an
apricot, it spoils the whole fruit, and in this way may ruin half a dozen in
taking a single meal. It is safe to say that the fruit pulp found In the stomach
does not represent more than one-fifth of what is actually destroyed. That
the linnets are persistent and voracious eaters of early fruits, especially cherries
and apricots, every fruit raiser hi California will bear testimony. That the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span>
damage is often serious no one will deny. It is noticeable, however, that the
earliest varieties are the ones most affected; also, that in large orchards the
damage is not perceptible, while in small plantations the whole crop is frequently
destroyed.</p>

<p>The crow blackbird or grackle<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>) in one or more of its subspecies is a
familiar object in all the States east of the Rocky Mountains. Throughout
the year it is resident as far north as southern Illinois, and in summer extends
its range into the Canadian Provinces. In the Mississippi Valley it is one of
the most abundant of birds, preferring to nest in the artificial groves and
windbreaks near farms instead of in the natural &ldquo;timber&rdquo; which it formerly
used. It breeds also in parks and near buildings, often in considerable colonies.
Farther east, in New England, it is only locally abundant, though frequently
seen in migration. In the latter days of August and throughout September it
is found in immense numbers before moving southward.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;Purple grackle. Length, about 12 inches.</div>
</div>

<p>The grackle is accused of many sins, such as stealing grain and fruit and
robbing the nests of other birds. An examination of 2,346 stomachs shows
that nearly one-third of its food consists of insects, most of which are injurious.
The bird also eats a few snails, crawfishes, salamanders, small fish, and occasionally
a mouse. The stomach contents do not indicate that it robs other
birds&rsquo; nests to any great extent, as
remains of birds and birds&rsquo; eggs
amount to less than half of 1
per cent.</p>

<p>It is on account of its vegetable
food that the grackle most deserves
condemnation. Grain is eaten during
the whole year, and only for
a short time in summer is other
food attractive enough to induce
the bird to alter its diet. The
grain taken in winter and spring
probably consists of waste kernels
from stubble. The stomachs do not
indicate that the bird pulls sprouting
grain; but the wheat eaten in
July and August and the corn eaten
in the fall are probably from fields
of standing grain. The total
amount of grain consumed during
the year constitutes 45 per cent of the food, but it is safe to say that at least
half is waste grain and consequently of no value. Although the crow blackbird
eats a few cherries and blackberries in their season, and in the fall some
wild fruit, it apparently does no damage in this way.</p>

<p>Large flocks of grackles no doubt do considerable injury to grain crops, and
there seems to be no remedy, except the destruction of the birds, which is in
itself expensive. During the breeding season, however, the species does much
good by eating insects and by feeding them to its young, which are reared
almost entirely upon this food. The bird does the greatest amount of good in
spring, when it follows the plow in search of large grubworms, of which it is
so fond that it sometimes literally crams its stomach full of them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="BREWER_BLACKBIRD" id="BREWER_BLACKBIRD">BREWER BLACKBIRD.</a></p>


<p>The Brewer blackbird<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> takes the place in the Western States of the grackle,
or crow blackbird, which lives in the Mississippi Valley and farther east and is
very similar in appearance and habits. It breeds east to the Great Plains and
north into Canada, and winters over most of its breeding range in the United
States and south to Guatemala. At home in fields, meadows, and orchards, and
about ranch buildings and cultivated lands generally, it nests in bushes and
weeds, sometimes in trees, and is very gregarious, especially about barnyards
and corrals. The bird feeds freely in stockyards and in cultivated fields, and
when fruit is ripe does not hesitate to take a share During the cherry season
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span>
in California the birds are much in the orchards. In one case they were
observed feeding on cherries, but when a neighboring fruit grower began to
plow his orchard almost every blackbird in the vicinity was upon the newly
opened ground close after the plowman&rsquo;s heels in its eagerness to secure the
insects turned up.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>The laboratory investigation of this bird&rsquo;s food covered 312 stomachs, collected
in every month and representing especially the fruit and grain sections
of southern California. The animal portion of the food was 32 per cent and
the vegetable 68 per cent.</p>

<p>Caterpillars and their pupæ amounted to 12 per cent of the whole food and
were eaten every month. They include many of those pests known as cutworms.
The cotton-boll worm, or corn-ear worm, was identified in at least 10 stomachs,
and in 11 were found pupæ of the codling moth. The animal food also included
other insects, and spiders, sow bugs, snails, and eggshells.</p>

<p>The vegetable food may be divided into fruit, grain, and weed seeds. Fruit
was eaten in May, June, and July, not a trace appearing in any other month,
and was composed of cherries, or what was thought to be such, strawberries,
blackberries or raspberries, and fruit pulp or skins not further identified.
However, the amount, a little more than 4 per cent for the year, was too small
to make a bad showing, and if the bird does no greater harm than is involved
in its fruit eating it is well worth protecting. Grain amounts to 54 per cent
of the yearly food and forms a considerable percentage in each month; oats
are the favorite and were the sole contents of 14 stomachs, and wheat of 2, but
no stomach was completely filled with any other grain. Weed seeds, eaten in
every month to the extent of 9 per cent of the food, were found in rather small
quantities and irregularly, and appear to have been merely a makeshift.</p>

<p>Stomachs of nestlings, varying in age from 24 hours to some that were nearly
fledged, were found to contain 89 per cent animal to 11 per cent vegetable matter.
The largest items in the former
were caterpillars, grasshoppers, and
spiders. In the latter the largest
items were fruit, probably cherries;
grain, mostly oats; and rubbish.</p>

<p>Brilliancy of plumage, sweetness
of song, and food habits to which no
exception can be taken are some of
the striking characteristics of the
Baltimore oriole<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> (<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>). In summer
it is found throughout the northern
half of the United States east of
the Great Plains. Its nest commands
hardly less admiration than the
beauty of its plumage or the excellence of its song. Hanging from the tip of
the outermost bough of a stately elm, it is almost inaccessible to depredators
and so strongly fastened as to bid defiance to the elements.</p>

<p>Observation both in the field and laboratory shows that caterpillars constitute
the largest item of the fare of the oriole. In 204 stomachs they formed 34
per cent of the food, and they are eaten in varying quantities during all the
months in which the bird remains in this country. The fewest are eaten in
July, when a little fruit also is taken. The other insects consist of beetles, bugs,
ants, wasps, grasshoppers, and some spiders. The beetles are principally click
beetles, the larvæ of which are among the most destructive insects known; and
the bugs include plant and bark lice, both very harmful, but so small and
obscure as to be passed over unnoticed by most birds. Ants are eaten mostly
in spring, grasshoppers in July and August, and wasps and spiders with considerable
regularity throughout the season.</p>

<p>During the stay of the oriole in the United States, vegetable matter amounts
to only a little more than 16 per cent of its food, so that the possibility of its
doing much damage to crops is very limited. The bird is accused of eating peas
to a considerable extent, but remains of such were found in only two cases.
One writer says that it damages grapes, but none were found in the stomachs.</p>

<p>The Bullock oriole<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> is practically a counterpart of the Baltimore oriole,
taking the place of that species west of the Plains and throughout the Pacific
coast region. It does not essentially differ in its habits of nesting or in its food
from its eastern relative, but it is less beautiful in plumage. The examination
of 162 stomachs shows that 79 per cent of its food consists of insects, with a few
spiders, a lizard, a mollusk shell, and eggshells. Beetles amounted to 35 per
cent, and all except a few ladybugs were harmful species. Ants were found in
19 stomachs, and in one there was nothing else. Bees, wasps, etc., were in 56
stomachs, and entirely filled 2 of them. Including the ants, they amount to
nearly 15 per cent of the food of the season.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>One of the most interesting articles of food in the oriole&rsquo;s dietary was the
black olive scale, found in 45 stomachs, and amounting to 5 per cent of the
food. In several cases these scales formed 80 per cent or more of the contents,
and in one, 30 individual scales could be counted. They were evidently a
standard article of diet, and were eaten regularly in every month of the oriole&rsquo;s
stay except April. Hemipterous insects other than scales, eaten quite regularly,
make up a little more than 5 per cent of the food. They were mostly
stinkbugs, leaf hoppers, and tree hoppers. Plant lice were found in one stomach.</p>

<p>Moths, pupæ, and caterpillars compose the largest item of the oriole&rsquo;s animal
food; the average consumption during its summer stay Is a little more than
41 per cent. Of these, perhaps the most interesting were the pupæ and larvæ
of the codling moth. These were found in 23 stomachs, showing that they are
not an unusual article of diet. No less than 14 of the pupal cases were found
in one stomach, and as they are very fragile many others may have been present,
but broken beyond recognition.</p>

<p>Grasshoppers probably do not come much in the oriole&rsquo;s way. They were
eaten, however; to the extent of a little more than 3 per cent. But in spite of
the fact that grasshoppers are eaten so sparingly, 2 stomachs, both taken in
June, contained nothing else, and another contained 97 per cent of them.</p>

<p>Various insects and spiders, with a few other items, make up the rest of the
animal food, a little more than 5 per cent. Spiders are not important in the
oriole&rsquo;s food, but are probably eaten whenever found. They were identified in
44 stomachs, but in small numbers. The scales of a lizard were found in one
stomach and the shell of a snail in another.</p>

<p>The vegetable contingent of the oriole&rsquo;s food is mostly fruit, especially in
June and July, when it takes kindly to cherries and apricots, and sometimes
eats more than the fruit grower considers a fair share. However, no great
complaint is made against the bird, and it is probable that as a rule it does not
do serious harm. With such a good record as an insect eater it can well be
spared a few cherries.</p>

closely related western species,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> which extends thence westward to the Pacific.
It winters from our southern border as far north as the District of Columbia,
southern Illinois, and occasionally Iowa. The western, form winters somewhat
farther north. Although it is a bird of the plains, and finds its most congenial
haunts in the prairies of the West, it is at home wherever there is level or
undulating land covered with grass or weeds, with plenty of water at hand.</p>

<p>In the 1,514 stomachs examined, animal food (practically all insects) constituted
74 per cent of the contents and vegetable matter 26 per cent. As would
naturally be supposed, the insects were ground species, as beetles, bugs, grasshoppers,
and caterpillars, with a few flies, wasps, and spiders. A number of the
stomachs were collected when the ground was covered with snow, but even
these contained a large percentage of insects, showing the bird&rsquo;s skill in finding
proper food under adverse circumstances.</p>

<p>Of the various insects eaten, crickets and grasshoppers are the most important,
constituting 26 per cent of the food of the year and 72 per cent of the
food in August. It is scarcely necessary to mention the beneficial effect of a
number of these birds on a field of grass in the height of the grasshopper season.
Of the 1,514 stomachs collected at all seasons of the year, 778, or more than
half, contained remains of grasshoppers, and one was filled with fragments of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span>
37 of these insects. This seems to show conclusively that grasshoppers are
preferred, and are eaten whenever they can be found. Especially notable
is the great number taken in August, the month when grasshoppers reach their
maximum abundance; stomach examination shows that large numbers of birds
resort at this time to this diet, no matter what may be the food during the
rest of the year.</p>

<p>Next to grasshoppers, beetles make up the most important item of the
meadowlark&rsquo;s food, amounting to 25 per cent, about one-half of which are predacious
ground beetles. The others are all harmful species.</p>

<p>Forty-two individuals of different kinds of May beetles were found in the
stomachs of meadowlarks, and there were probably many more which were
past recognition. To this form and several closely allied ones belong the
numerous white grubs, which are among the worst enemies to many cultivated
crops, notably grasses and grains, and to a less extent strawberries and garden
vegetables. In the larval stage they eat the roots of these plants, and being
large, one individual may destroy several plants. In the adult stage they feed
upon the foliage of trees and other plants, and in this way add to the damage
which they began in the earlier form. As these enemies of husbandry are not
easily destroyed by man, it is obviously wise to encourage their natural foes.</p>

<p>Among the weevils found in the stomachs the most important economically
are the cotton-boll weevil and the recently introduced alfalfa weevil of Utah.
Several hundred meadowlarks were taken in the cotton-growing region, and
the boll weevil was found in 25 stomachs of the eastern meadowlark and in 16
of the western species. Of the former, one stomach contained 27 individuals.
Of 25 stomachs of western meadowlarks
taken in alfalfa fields of Utah,
15 contained the alfalfa weevil. In
one stomach 23 adults were found,
in another 32 adults and 70 larvæ,
still another had 10 adults and 40
larvæ, and a fourth had 4 adults
and 100 larvæ.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>&mdash;Meadowlark. Length, about 10 inches.</div>
</div>

<p>Caterpillars form a very constant
element of the food, and in May
constitute over 24 per cent of the
whole. May is the month when the
dreaded cutworm begins Its deadly
career, and then the lark does some
of its best work. Most of these
caterpillars are ground feeders,
and are overlooked by birds which
habitually frequent trees, but the meadowlark finds and devours them
by thousands. The remainder of the insect food is made up of ants, wasps,
and spiders, with some bugs, including chinch bugs, and a few scales.</p>

<p>The vegetable food consists of grain and weed and other hard seeds. Grain
in general amounts to 11 per cent and weed and other seeds to 7 per cent.
Grain, principally corn, is eaten mostly in winter and early spring and consists,
therefore, of waste kernels; only a trifle is consumed in summer and
autumn, when it is most plentiful. No trace of sprouting grain was discovered.
Glover seed was found in only six stomachs, and but little in each. Seeds of
weeds, principally ragweed, barnyard grass, and smartweed, are eaten from November
to April, inclusive, but during the rest of the year are replaced by insects.</p>

<p>Briefly stated, more than half of the meadowlark&rsquo;s food consists of harmful
insects; its vegetable food is composed either of noxious weeds or waste grain;
and the remainder is made up of useful beetles or neutral insects and spiders.
A strong point in the bird&rsquo;s favor is that, although naturally an insect eater, it
is able to subsist on vegetable food, and consequently is not forced to migrate
in cold weather farther than is necessary to find ground free from snow.</p>

<p>The red-winged or swamp blackbird<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> in its various forms (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>) is found
all over the United States and the region immediately to the north. While
common in most of its range, its distribution is more or less local, mainly on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
account of its partiality for marshes. It builds its nest over or near standing
water, in tall grass, rushes, or bushes. Owing to this peculiarity the bird may
be absent from large tracts of country which afford no swamps or marshes
suitable for nesting. It usually breeds in large colonies, though single families,
consisting of a male and several females, may sometimes be found in a small
slough, where each female builds her nest and rears her own little brood. While
her liege lord displays his brilliant colors and struts in the sunshine. In the
upper Mississippi Valley the species finds most favorable conditions, for the
countless prairie sloughs and the margins of the numerous shallow lakes afford
nesting sites for thousands of red-wings; and here are bred the immense flocks
which sometimes do so much damage to the grain fields of the West. After the
breeding season the birds congregate preparatory to migration, and remain
thus associated throughout the winter.</p>

<p>Three species and several subspecies of red-wings are recognized,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> but practically
no difference exists in the habits of these forms either in nesting or
feeding, except such as may result from local conditions. Most of the forms are
found on the Pacific side of the continent, and may be considered as included in
the following statements as to food and economic status.</p>

<p>Many complaints have been made against the red-wing, and several States
have at times placed a bounty upon its head. It is said to cause great damage
to grain in the West, especially in the upper Mississippi Valley, but few complaints
come from the northeastern
section, where the bird is much
less abundant than in the West
and South.</p>

<p>Examination of 1,083 stomachs
showed that vegetable matter
forms 74 per cent of the food,
while animal matter, mainly Insects,
forms but 26 per cent A
little more than 10 per cent consists
of beetles, mostly harmful
species. Weevils, or snout beetles,
amount to 4 per cent of the year&rsquo;s
food, but in June reach 25 per cent.
As weevils are among the most
harmful insects known, their destruction
should condone some, at
least, of the sins of which the
bird is accused. Grasshoppers
constitute nearly 5 per cent of the
food, while the rest of the animal
matter is made up of various
insects, a few snails, and crustaceans.
The few dragon flies found were probably picked up dead, for they
are too active to be taken alive, unless by a bird of the flycatcher family. So
far as the insect food as a whole is concerned, the red-wing may be considered
entirely beneficial.</p>

<p>The interest in the vegetable food of this bird centers around grain. Only
three kinds, corn, wheat, and oats, were found in the stomachs in appreciable
quantities. They aggregate but little more than 13 per cent of the whole food,
oats forming nearly half of this amount. Field investigation has shown, however,
that, when local conditions are favorable, large flocks of red-wings may
do considerable damage. Conspicuous among such cases are the losses suffered
by farmers to sweet corn in some of the northeastern States and to milo in the
South and West. In the rather limited grain-raising area of the Imperial
Valley of California the annual damage to milo alone by enormous flocks of
red-wings and yellow-headed blackbirds has been estimated to be fully $50,000.
The most important item of the bird&rsquo;s food, however, is weed seed, which forms
practically all of its food in winter and about 57 per cent of the fare of the
whole year. The principal weed seeds eaten are those of ragweed, barnyard
grass, and smartweed. That these seeds are preferred is shown by the fact
that the birds begin to eat them in August, when grain is still readily obtainable,
and continue feeding on them even after insects become plentiful in April.
The red-wing eats very little fruit and does practically no harm to garden or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span>
orchard. It is apparent that where moderately abundant, the red-wing does
more good than harm, but in sections where it becomes excessively abundant
a reduction in its numbers is justifiable.</p>

<p>The bobolink, ricebird, or reedbird<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>) is a common summer resident
of the United States, north of about latitude 40°, and from New England westward
to the Great Plains, wintering beyond our southern border. In New
England there are few birds about which so much romance clusters as this
rollicking songster, naturally associated with sunny June meadows; but in the
South there are none on whose head so many maledictions have been heaped
on account of its fondness for rice. During its sojourn in the Northern States
it feeds mainly upon insects and
seeds of useless plants; but while
rearing its young, insects constitute
its chief food, and almost the exclusive
diet of its brood. After the
young are able to fly, the whole family
gathers into a small flock and
begins to live almost entirely upon
vegetable food. This consists for
the most part of weed seeds, since
In the North these birds do not appear
to attack grain to any great
extent. They eat a few oats, but their
stomachs do not reveal a great quantity
of this or any other grain. As
the season advances they gather into
larger flocks and move southward,
until by the end of August nearly all
have left their breeding grounds. On
their way they frequent the reedy
marshes about the mouths of rivers
and on the inland waters of the coast
region and subsist largely upon wild
rice. In the Middle States, during their southward migration, they are commonly
known as reedbirds, and, becoming very fat, are treated as game.</p>

<p>Formerly, when the low marshy shores of the Carolinas and some of the
more southern States were devoted to rice culture the bobolinks made great
havoc both upon the sprouting rice in spring and upon the ripening grain on
their return migration in the fall. While the damage is not so great as when
this region was the center of rice production, still it amounts to many thousands
of dollars annually. As a remedy, an open season on ricebirds was provided
in the Coast States from New Jersey to Florida.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="CROW" id="CROW">CROW.</a></p>


<p>In one or another of its geographic races the common crow<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> (<a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>) breeds
in great numbers throughout the States east of the Plains and from the Gulf
well up into Canada, while in less abundance it is found in California and in
the Northwestern States. During the colder months a southern migratory
movement brings most of these birds within the borders of the United States,
and at about the latitude of Philadelphia and southern Illinois we find them
congregating nightly in roosts. Farmers dwelling in the vicinity of such roosts
frequently suffer losses to shocked corn.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_44_44" id="Footnote_44_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> <i>Corvus brachyrhynchos</i>.</p></div>

<p>In fact, none of our native birds so much concerns the average farmer of the
Eastern States as the common crow. Many of our present criticisms of this
bird, as its pulling sprouting corn, feeding on ripening ears, damaging fruits of
various kinds, destroying poultry and wild birds, and disseminating diseases
of live-stock, were common complaints in the days of the early colonists. Many
of the virtues of the crow, now quite generally recognized, also have been
matters of record for many years. In recent times, however, scientific study
of these problems, including the examination of the stomachs of hundreds of
crows secured in every month of the year and under a variety of conditions,
has enabled us to render a much fairer verdict than was formerly possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span></p>

<p>The crow is practically omnivorous. During spring and early summer any
form of insect life seems to make a desirable item in its diet, and in winter
when hard pressed nothing in the animal or vegetable kingdoms which contains
a morsel of nutriment is overlooked.</p>

<p>The insect food of the crow, which comprises about a fifth of its yearly
sustenance, does much to atone for its misdemeanors. Grasshoppers, May
beetles and their larvæ (white grubs), caterpillars, weevils, and wireworms
stand out prominently. In 1,340 stomachs of adults examined these highly Injurious
forms comprised over 80 per cent of the insect food. Grasshoppers are
naturally taken in greatest abundance late in the season. September being the
month of largest consumption, when they form about a fifth of the total food.
May beetles and white grubs are eaten in every month, but occur most
prominently in May. In June caterpillars are a favorite food, and weevils of
various kinds are taken in varying quantities throughout summer and fall.
About half of the remaining 20 per cent of insect food is composed of beneficial
ground beetles, ladybirds, predacious bugs, and parasitic wasps, and related
forms, the rest consisting of neutral or injurious forms. Numerous instances
are on record where fields badly infested with white grubs or grasshoppers
have been favorite resorts of crows, whose voracity has resulted in a material
suppression of the pest. When the amount of food required to sustain the
individual crow is considered, the work of these birds appears all the more
important Single stomachs containing
upward of 50 grasshoppers
are not uncommon. Thus in
its choice of insect food the crow
is rendering an important service
to the farmer.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 279px;">
<a id="fig16" name="fig16"></a>
<img src="images/fig16.png" width="279" height="194" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span>&mdash;Crow. Length, about 19 inches.</div>
</div>

<p>In the other animal food of
the crow are several items of
the utmost economic importance.
Spiders are taken in considerable
numbers in May and June,
but the yearly total is a little
over 1 per cent of the food.
In early spring crawfish are
eagerly sought, and other aquatic
food, as fish and mollusks, lend
variety to the crow&rsquo;s bill of
fare the year round. In the consumption
of toads, salamanders,
frogs, and some snakes, which together compose a little over 2 per cent of the
yearly food, the crow is doubtless doing harm. Small rodents occurred in the
stomachs collected nearly every month, but it Is often difficult to determine
whether small mammals found in birds&rsquo; stomachs were taken alive or found dead.</p>

<p>From its carrion-eating habits the crow has been unfairly criticized as a
disseminator of live-stock diseases. While this may be to some extent just, the
fact that there are many other important carriers which lie largely beyond our
control, shows that we must seek final relief only through the strictest methods
of sanitation.</p>

<p>The nest-robbing habit of the crow, long a serious criticism, is verified by
stomach analysis. Of the 1,103 crows examined, 47 had fed on wild birds or
their eggs, and the eggs of domestic fowls were found somewhat more frequently.
The crow&rsquo;s habit of rummaging about garbage piles may explain
much of this latter material.</p>

<p>Of the vegetable food, corn, which is eaten every month, is the most important
item and forms about 38 per cent of the diet. Much of this, however,
must be considered waste, since over 60 per cent of it is consumed from the first
of November to the end of March. During the periods when corn is sprouting
and when in the &ldquo;roasting-ear&rdquo; stage the crow is eating this grain at a rate
considerably less than the yearly average, and the months of smallest consumption
are July and August. At times, however, the damage to corn becomes a
serious problem, and were it not possible to make use of such deterrents as coal
tar upon seed corn there would be little friendship for the crow in some sections
of the East. The &ldquo;pulling&rdquo; of corn is a trait most prevalent in small-field
areas. Wheat and oats suffer similar damage at times, especially in the
Northwestern States, where these grains predominate. About the only safeguard
to ripening grain is the constant use of powder and shot or the scarecrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span></p>

<p>Various kinds of cultivated fruits are also eaten, and local damage to such
crops as apples, melons, peas, beans, peanuts, and almonds is occasionally reported.
In long, rigorous winters, the crow, like other birds, resorts to the
fruit of numerous wild plants, as dogwood, sour gum, hackberry, smilax, and the
several species of sumac and poison ivy.</p>

<p>Damage to the eggs of poultry may be reduced to a minimum by careful
housing of lasting hens, and the farmer can protect his sprouting grain to a
large extent by the use of tar-coated seed. It will be well also to keep the
crow within reasonable numbers on game preserves and public parks where it
is desired to encourage the nesting of smaller birds. While legal protection is
not needed for so wary an individual as the crow, it seems well, where local
conditions have not aggravated some particular shortcomings of the bird, to
allow it to continue the good services gendered to man in the destruction of
noxious insects.</p>

<p>The blue jay<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>) is a conspicuous member of our bird population east
of the Plains, especially in autumn when his brilliant plumage contrasts vividly
with the brown> foliage. Even in winter he stays with us, though at this time
he is less common along our northern border. In spring and summer, while by
no means uncommon, the blue jay is not so often noticed, as the retiring disposition
which he assumes during the breeding season assists in protecting him
from enemies. This also allows him to carry on with considerable impunity
that inglorious practice of nest robbing
of which, in a measure, he has
been rightfully accused.</p>

</div>

<p>Examination of 530 stomachs collected
at all times of the year in 30
of our Eastern States and Canada
shows that insects comprise about
22 per cent of the yearly sustenance.
About three-fourths of these are injurious,
the remainder being neutral
or beneficial. Of the injurious insects,
grasshoppers form the largest
portion; in August nearly a fifth of
the food. Caterpillars are conspicuous
in July and August and at this
time average about a tenth of the
stomach contents. Both laboratory
investigations and field observations have established the fact that in winter the
eggs of the tent caterpillar and the hibernating larvæ of the brown-tail moth in
New England are eagerly sought Scarabæid beetles form about 4 per cent of
the yearly food, and click beetles and wire-worms about 1 per cent. Of the
beneficial forms, ground beetles (3 per cent) and hymenopterous insects, part
of which are parasitic (2.5 per cent), are taken most frequently. A few other
invertebrates, as spiders, millipedes, mollusks, and crustaceans, also are eaten
throughout the year.</p>

<p>In the consideration of the vertebrate food of the blue jay we are confronted
with the problem of the destruction of wild birds and their eggs. Special
search was made for every possible trace of such material in the stomachs,
and in 6 of the 530 were found the remains of wild birds or their eggs. In
February two jays had killed a small bird apiece; in May one had robbed a
nest of eggs; in June two had taken a small bird and a clutch of eggs, respectively;
and in August another had robbed a nest As this trait of the jay appears
to be most pronounced during its own breeding season, it is quite possible
for many birds which have suffered from its boldness early in the season to raise
another brood unmolested. Thirty-nine of the 530 jays examined had fed
on hen&rsquo;s eggs. Much of this food, however, was picked up about rubbish heaps,
to which the jay, like other members of the crow family, is partial. While
the result of stomach analysis would appear to belittle this fault of the blue
jay, it is doubtless quite characteristic of the bird under favorable conditions.</p>

<p>Complaint that the jay is the source of considerable damage to corn in the
fall has been verified to a certain degree by stomach examination. This grain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span>
is taken in every month of the year, but in greater quantities during winter and
early spring, when much of it is necessarily waste, and it forms about 18 per
cent of the yearly food. Cultivated fruits of various kinds are eaten from
June to the end of the year, and the 15 per cent taken in July apparently justifies
complaints against the bird on this score. The favorite vegetable food of the
blue jay is mast of various kinds, acorns predominating, but beechnuts, chestnuts,
chinquaquins, and hazelnuts also are relished. This food is important in
every month but July and August, the yearly average being over 43 per cent,
and from October to March it constitutes about two-thirds of the diet. Occasionally
harm is done by feeding also on cultivated nuts, as pecans. Wild fruits
are eaten during the summer and fall and constitute about 7 per cent of the
yearly sustenance.</p>

<p>The blue jay probably renders its best services to man in destroying grasshoppers
late in the season and in feeding on hibernating insects and their eggs,
as it does in the case of the tent caterpillar and brown-tail moth. Such forest
insects as buprestid beetles and weevils of various kinds also fall as its prey.</p>

<p>The blue jay&rsquo;s vegetable food, with the exception of some cultivated fruit and
corn in the fall, is largely neutral. The severest criticism against the species
is the destruction of other birds and their eggs. Where we wish to attract birds
in large numbers about our dooryards, in our parks, and in game preserves, it
will be well not to allow the jays to become too abundant.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="PACIFIC_COAST_JAYS" id="PACIFIC_COAST_JAYS">PACIFIC COAST JAYS.</a></p>


<p>In California and adjacent States two species of jays are much in evidence
under several more or less well-marked forms.</p>

<p>The Steller jay<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> much resembles the eastern bird, but it is more shy and
retiring and seldom visits the orchard or vicinity of the ranch buildings.
Stomach examination shows that its food does not radically differ from that of
the eastern blue jay. As is the case with that bird, a very considerable part
of the food consists of mast, together with a little fruit and some insects. The
insects are largely wasps, with some beetles and grasshoppers. This jay also
eats some grain, which is probably waste or volunteer. No complaints, so far
as known, are made against this bird. Until it shall become less wary it is not
likely to trespass to a serious extent upon the farmer&rsquo;s preserve.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_46_46" id="Footnote_46_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> <i>Cyanocitta stelleri</i>.</p></div>

<p>The California jay,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> although of a different genus, more nearly resembles its
eastern relative in food habits and actions. It freely visits the stockyards near
ranch buildings, and orchards and gardens. As a fruit stealer it is notorious.
One instance is recorded where seven jays were shot from a prune tree, one
after the other, the dead bodies being left under the tree until all were killed.
So eager were the birds to get the fruit that the report of the gun and the sight
of their dead did not deter them from coming to the tree. In orchards in
canyons or on hillsides adjacent to chaparral or other cover great mischief is
done by this bird. In one such case an orchard was under observation at a time
when the prune crop was ripening, and jays in a continuous stream were seen
to come down a small ravine to the orchard, prey upon the fruit, and return.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_47_47" id="Footnote_47_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> <i>Aphelocoma californica</i>.</p></div>

<p>Fruit stealing, however, is only one of the sins of the California jay. That
it robs hens&rsquo; nests is universal testimony. A case is reported of a hen having
a nest under a clump of bushes; every day a jay came to a tree a few rods away,
and when it heard the cackle of the hen announcing a new egg it flew at once
to the nest. At the same time the mistress of the house hastened to the spot
to secure the prize, but in most cases the jay won the race. This is only one of
many similar cases recounted. The jays have learned just what the cackle of
the hen means. Another case more serious is that related by a man engaged
in raising white leghorn fowls on a ranch several miles up a canyon. He
stated that when the chicks were very young the jays attacked and killed
them by a few blows of the beak and then pecked open the skull and ate out
the brains. In spite of all efforts to protect the chicks and kill the jays the
losses in this way were serious.</p>

<p>Examination of the stomachs of 326 California jays shows that 27 per cent
of the contents for the year consists of animal matter and 73 per cent of vegetable.
Although the great bulk of the animal food is made up of insects, the
remains of eggshells and birds&rsquo; bones appear much too often. The insect food
is fairly well distributed among the more common orders, but grasshoppers are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span>
slightly the most numerous and constitute 4.5 per cent of the year&rsquo;s food. In
July, August, and September, however, the amount is 14, 18, and 19 per cent,
respectively. Four per cent of the food consists of wasps, bees, etc., but in the
three months named they constitute 15, 7, and 9 per cent, respectively. A
worker honeybee found in each of two stomachs is rather surprising, for it is
unusual to find a bird like the jay eating these active and elusive insects,
which enter into the diet of the flycatchers. The remainder of the insect
food is pretty evenly distributed among beetles, bugs, flies, and caterpillars.
Eggshells were found in 21 stomachs and birds&rsquo; bones in 5. Six stomachs
contained the bones of mammals and two those of a lizard. No bird has a
worse reputation for nest robbing than has the eastern jay, and yet of 530
stomachs of the eastern species only 6 contained eggshells or the bones of
birds. This comparison serves to show what a marauder and nest thief the
California jay really is.</p>

<p>In its vegetable diet this bird much resembles its eastern relative, the most
remarkable difference being in the matter of fruit eating. With greater opportunities
the California bird has developed a greater appetite for fruit and
indulges it to the fullest extent. Remains of fruit were found in 220 of the 326
stomachs. The percentage for the year is only 16, but for the four months of
June, July, August, and September it is 44, 33, 53, and 25, respectively. Cherries,
apricots, and prunes are the favorites among cultivated fruits, and elderberries
are relished to some extent. Grain, which was found in 48 stomachs,
amounts to 6 per cent of the food of the year. Practically all of it was taken
in the four months above mentioned, but it is not probable that much damage
is done by the jay in this respect. The major portion of the grain was oats.
What was not wild was probably simply scattered grain gleaned after the
harvest. Mast is eaten by the California jay from September to March, inclusive,
and constitutes during most of that period one of the principal elements of
its food. In this respect the bird shows a remarkable similarity to the eastern
species. A few weed seeds and other miscellaneous items make up the balance
of the vegetable food.</p>

<p>In summing up from an economic point of view the character of the food
of the California jay, it must be conceded that it is not all that could be wished.
Its taste for birds&rsquo; eggs and fruit is entirely too pronounced, and at present the
species is superabundant in California. While the natural food supply of the
bird has been lessened by bringing the woods and brushy canyons under cultivation,
the same areas have been planted to fruit, and naturally the jay takes
the fruit as an acceptable substitute. A considerable reduction of the bird&rsquo;s
numbers would appear to be the only effective remedy.</p>

<p>Among the early spring arrivals to their northern homes none is more welcome
than the ph&oelig;be (<a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>). The common ph&oelig;be<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> breeds throughout the
United States east of the Great Plains, and winters from the South Atlantic
and Gulf States southward. Its western relative, the black ph&oelig;be,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> is found
from Texas west to the Pacific coast, which it occupies as far north as Washington,
replacing through most of this region the common or eastern form.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> <i>Sayornis ph&oelig;be</i>.</p></div>

<p>Though naturally building its nest under an overhanging cliff of rock or
earth, or in the mouth of a cave, the preference of the eastern species for the
vicinity of farm buildings is so marked that in the more thickly settled parts
of the country the bird is seldom seen at any great distance from a farmhouse,
except where a bridge spanning a stream affords a secure spot for a nest. Its
confiding disposition renders it a great favorite, and consequently it is seldom
disturbed.</p>

<p>The ph&oelig;be subsists almost exclusively upon insects, most of which are caught
upon the wing. An examination of 370 stomachs showed that over 89 per cent
of the year&rsquo;s food consists of insects and spiders, while wild fruit constitutes
the remainder. The insects belong chiefly to noxious species, and include many
click beetles. May beetles, and weevils. Other beetles, belonging to 21 families
that were identified, make up 10.65 per cent. They appear to be eaten very
regularly in every month, but the most are taken in spring and early summer.
May is the month of maximum consumption, with 20.43 per cent. Beetles altogether
amount to 15.3 per cent, which places them second in rank of the items
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
of animal food. The notorious cotton-boll weevil was found in six stomachs
taken in the cotton fields of Texas and Louisiana, and five individuals of the
strawberry weevil were taken from one collected in Texas. Many other beetles
contained In the stomachs are equally harmful, but are not so widely known.
Such are the corn leaf-beetle, which feeds upon corn; the 12-spotted cucumber
beetle, and the striped cucumber beetle, both of which seriously injure and
sometimes destroy cucumber and squash vines; and the locust leaf miner,
which is sometimes so numerous that all the locust trees over large areas are
blasted as by fire.</p>

<p>In the ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s diet hymenopterous insects stand at the head, as is the case
with most of the flycatchers. They are eaten with great regularity and are
the largest item in nearly every month. A few are useful parasitic species,
but these are offset by a number of sawfly larvæ, which are very harmful
insects. Ants were found in 24 stomachs. No honeybees were identified. In
their season grasshoppers are much relished, while wasps of various forms,
many flies of species that annoy cattle, and a few bugs and spiders are also
eaten regularly. It is evident that a pair of ph&oelig;bes must materially reduce
the number of insects near a garden or field, as the birds often, if not always,
raise two broods a year, and each brood numbers from four to six young.</p>

<p>There is hardly a more useful species about the farm than the ph&oelig;be, and
it should receive every encouragement. To furnish nesting boxes is helpful,
but not necessary, as it usually prefers a more open situation, like a shed or
a nook under the eaves, but it should
be protected from cats and other
marauders.</p>

</div>

<p>The black ph&oelig;be has the same
habits as its eastern relative, both
as to selection of food and nesting
sites, preferring for the latter purpose
some structure of man, as a
shed or, better still, a bridge over
a stream of water, and the preference
of the black ph&oelig;be for the
vicinity of water is very pronounced.
One may always be found at a stream&rsquo;
or pool and often at a watering
trough by the roadside.</p>

<p>Careful study of the habits of the
bird shows that it obtains a large
portion of Its food about wet places.
While camping beside a stream in
California the writer took some
pains to observe the habits of the
black ph&oelig;be. The nesting season
was over, and the birds had nothing
to do but eat. This they appeared to be doing all the time. When first observed
in the morning, at the first glimmer of daylight, a ph&oelig;be was always found
flitting from rock to rock, although it was so dusky that the bird could hardly
be seen. This activity was kept up all day. Even in the evening, when it
was so dark that notes were written by the aid of the camp fire, the ph&oelig;be
was still engaged in its work of collecting, though it was difficult to understand
how it could catch insects when there was scarcely light enough to see
the bird. Exploration of the stream showed that every portion of it was
patrolled by a ph&oelig;be, that each one apparently did not range over more than 12
or 13 rods of water, and that sometimes two or three were in close proximity.</p>

<p>The number of insects destroyed in a year by the black ph&oelig;be is enormous.
Fortunately, the examination of stomachs has supplemented observation in
the field, and we are enabled to give precise details. Of the 333 stomachs examined,
every one contained insects as the great bulk of the food. Only 15
contained any vegetable food at all, and in no case was it a considerable part
of the contents of the stomach. The insects eaten were mostly wasps, bugs,
and flies, but many beetles also were destroyed.</p>

<p>Useful beetles belonging to three families amount to 2.8 per cent of the
food. Other beetles of harmful or neutral species reach 10.5 per cent. Wasps,
the largest item of the food, were found in 252 stomachs and were the whole
contents of 15. The average for the year is 35 per cent. Parasitic species
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span>
were noted, but they were very few. Ants were found in 48 stomachs, and for
a short time in midsummer they constitute a notable part of the food. Various
wild bees and wasps make up the bulk of this item. No honeybees were found.</p>

<p>Bugs in various forms constitute 10.56 per cent and are eaten in every month
but May. Stinkbugs appear to be the favorites, as they were contained in 10
stomachs. Plant lice were found in one stomach. Flies, forming the second
largest item, were found in 97 stomachs and completely filled 3. They constitute
the most regular article in the black ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s diet. The maximum consumption
occurs in April, 64.3 per cent. The black ph&oelig;be well merits its title
of flycatcher.</p>

<p>Moths and caterpillars amount to 8.2 per cent of the food. They were found
in 72 stomachs, of which 51 contained the adult moths and 28 the larvæ or
caterpillars. One stomach was entirely filled with adults. This is one of the
few birds studied by the writer that eats more moths than caterpillars, for as
a rule the caterpillars are largely in excess. Flycatchers, taking their food
upon the wing, would naturally prove exceptions to the rule. Crickets are
evidently not a favorite food of the black ph&oelig;be, as they amount to only 2.45
per cent. They were found in 39 stomachs, but usually the amount in each was
small, though one stomach was entirely filled with them. Grasshoppers did
not appear. Dragon flies were eaten to some extent, and these illustrate the
fondness of the species for the neighborhood of water.</p>

<p>The vegetable matter eaten consisted chiefly of small wild fruits of no
economic importance.</p>

<p>Another ph&oelig;be inhabiting the Western States and breeding as far north as
Alaska is the Say ph&oelig;be.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Investigation of its food was based on the examination
of 86 stomachs, and while none were available for the months when
insects are most numerous, the bird proved to be one of the most exclusively
insectivorous of the family. That it takes a few useful insects can not be
denied, but these are far outnumbered by the harmful ones it destroys, and the
balance is clearly in favor of the bird. Its vegetable food amounts to only 2
per cent and is made up of a little wild fruit, seeds, and rubbish.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a id="THE_KINGBIRDS" name="THE_KINGBIRDS"></a>THE KINGBIRDS.</p>


<p>The well-known eastern kingbird<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>) is essentially a lover of the
orchard, though groves and the edge of forests were probably its original habitat.
It breeds in the States east of the Rocky Mountains, and less commonly in
the Great Basin and on the Pacific coast. Its hostility to hawks and crows is
proverbial, and for this reason a family of kingbirds is a desirable adjunct to
a poultry yard. On one occasion in the knowledge of the writer a hawk which
attacked a brood of young turkeys was pounced upon and so severely buffeted
by a pair of kingbirds whose nest was near by that the would-be robber was
glad to escape without his prey. Song birds that nest near the kingbird are
similarly protected.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> <i>Tyrannus tyrannus</i>.</p></div>

<p>The kingbird is largely insectivorous. It is a true flycatcher and takes on
the wing a large part of its food. It does not, however, confine itself to this
method of hunting, but picks up some insects from trees and weeds, and even
descends to the ground in search of myriapods or thousand legs. The chief
complaint against the species by both professional bee keepers and others has
been that it preys largely upon honeybees. One bee raiser in Iowa, suspecting
the kingbirds of feeding upon his bees, shot a number near his hives; but when
the stomachs of the birds were examined by an expert entomologist, not a trace
of honeybees could be found.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 260px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>&mdash;Kingbird. Length, about 8&frac12; inches.</div>
</div>

<p>An examination of 665 stomachs collected in various parts of the country,
was made by the Biological Survey, but only 22 were found to contain remains
of honeybees. In these 22 stomachs there were in all 61 honeybees, of which
51 were drones, 8 were certainly workers, and the remaining 2 were too badly
broken to be further identified.</p>

<p>The insects that constitute the great bulk of the food of the bird are noxious
species, largely beetles&mdash;May beetles, click beetles (the larvæ of which are
known as wire-worms), weevils, which prey upon fruit and grain, and a host
of others. Wasps, wild bees, and ants are conspicuous elements of the food, far
outnumbering the hive bees. During summer many grasshoppers and crickets,
as well as leaf hoppers and other bugs, also are eaten. In the stomachs examined
were a number of robber files&mdash;insects which prey largely upon other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span>
insects, including honeybees, and which are known to commit in this way
extensive depredations. It is thus evident that the kingbird by destroying these
flies actually does good work for the apiarist. The 26 robber flies found in the
stomachs may be considered more than an equivalent for the 8 worker honeybees
already mentioned. A few caterpillars are eaten, mostly belonging to the
group commonly known as cutworms, all the species of which are harmful.</p>

<p>About 11 per cent of the food consists of small native fruits, comprising some
30 common species of the roadsides and thickets, as dogwood berries, elderberries,
and wild grapes. The kingbird is not reported as eating cultivated
fruit to an injurious extent, and it is very doubtful if this is ever the case.</p>

<p>In the Western States the Arkansas kingbird<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> is not so domestic in its habits
as its eastern relative, preferring to live among scattering oaks on lonely hillsides,
rather than in orchards about ranch buildings. The work it does, however,
in the destruction of noxious insects fully equals that of any member of
its family. Like other flycatchers, it subsists mostly upon insects taken in
mid-air, though it eats a number of grasshoppers, probably taken from the
ground. The bulk of its food consists of beetles, bugs, wasps, and wild bees.
Like its eastern representative, it has been accused of feeding to an injurious
extent upon honeybees. In an examination of 62 stomachs of this species,
great care was taken to identify every insect or fragment that had any resemblance
to a honeybee; as a result,
30 honeybees were identified, of
which 29 were males or drones
and 1 a worker. These were contained
in four stomachs, and were
the sole contents of three; in the
fourth they constituted 99 per cent
of the food. It is evident that the
bee-eating habit is only occasional
and accidental, rather than habitual;
and it is also evident that
if this ratio of drones to workers
were maintained, the bird would be
of more benefit than harm to the
apiary.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_52_52" id="Footnote_52_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> <i>Tyrannus verticalis</i>.</p></div>

<p>The Cassin kingbird<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> has a more
southerly range than the Arkansas
flycatcher. Examination of a number
of stomachs shows that its food
habits are similar to those of others
of the group.</p>

<p>Three points seem to be clearly
established in regard to the food of
the kingbirds&mdash;(1) that about 90
per cent consists of insects, mostly
injurious species; (2) that the alleged habit of preying upon honeybees is much
less prevalent than has been supposed, and probably does not result in any
great damage; and (3) that the vegetable food consists almost entirely of
wild fruits which have no economic value.</p>

<p>All of the kingbirds are of the greatest importance to the farmer and fruit
grower, as they destroy vast numbers of harmful insects, and do no appreciable
damage to any product of cultivation.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="NIGHTHAWK" id="NIGHTHAWK">NIGHTHAWK.</a></p>


<p>The nighthawk, or bull-bat,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> breeds throughout most of the United States and
Canada, and winters in South America. It is strictly insectivorous, and hence
does no damage to crops. The only charge that can be made against the bird
is that it destroys some useful insects, but these are greatly in the minority in
its food.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> <i>Chordeiles virginianus</i>.</p></div>

<p>Nighthawks are so expert in flight that no insects can escape them. In their
capacious mouths they sweep up everything from the largest moths and dragon
flies to the tiniest ants and gnats, and in this way sometimes gather most
remarkable collections of insects. Several stomachs have contained 50 or more
different kinds, and the number of individuals ran into the thousands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">« 25 »</a></span></p>

<p>Nearly a fourth of the birds&rsquo; total food is composed of ants. These Insects
are generally annoying and often very injurious, especially on account of their
damage to stored products and because of their habit of fostering destructive
plant lice. More than a fifth of the nighthawk&rsquo;s food consists of June bugs,
dung beetles, and other beetles of the leaf-chafer family. These are the adults
of white grubs, noted pests, and even as adults many members of the family
are decidedly harmful.</p>

<p>Numerous other injurious beetles, as click beetles, wood borers, and weevils,
are relished. True bugs, moths, flies, grasshoppers, and crickets also are
important elements of the food. Several species of mosquitoes, including the
transmitter of malaria, are eaten. Other well-known pests consumed by the
nighthawk are Colorado potato beetles, cucumber beetles, rice, clover-leaf, and
cotton-boll weevils, billbugs, bark beetles, squash bugs, and moths of the cotton
worm.</p>

<p>Nighthawks are much less numerous than formerly, chiefly because of
wanton shooting. They are given full legal protection almost everywhere, and
citizens should see that the law is
obeyed. The bird is far too useful
and attractive to be persecuted.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span>&mdash;Hairy woodpecker. Length, about 9 inches.</div>
</div>

<p>Five or six species of woodpeckers
are familiarly known throughout
the eastern United States, and
In the West are replaced by others
of similar habits. Several species
remain in the Northern States
through the entire year, while
others are more or less migratory.</p>

<p>Farmers are prone to look upon
woodpeckers with suspicion. When
the birds are seen scrambling over
fruit trees and pecking holes in
the bark, it is concluded that they
must be doing harm. Careful observers,
however, have noticed
that, excepting a single species,
these birds rarely leave any conspicuous
mark on a healthy tree,
except when it is affected by wood-boring
larvæ, which are accurately
located, dislodged, and devoured
by the woodpecker.</p>

<p>Two of the best-known woodpeckers, the hairy woodpecker<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> (<a href="#fig20">fig. 20</a>) and the
downy woodpecker,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> including their races, range over the greater part of the
United States. They differ chiefly in size, their colors being practically the
same. The males, like those of many other woodpeckers, are distinguished by
a scarlet patch on the head. An examination of many stomachs of these two
species shows that from two-thirds to three-fourths of the food consists of
insects, chiefly noxious kinds. Wood-boring beetles, both adults and larvæ, are
conspicuous, and with them are associated many caterpillars, mostly species
that burrow into trees. Next in importance are the ants that live in decaying
wood, all of which are sought by woodpeckers and eaten in great quantities.
Many ants are particularly harmful to timber, for if they find a small spot of
decay in the vacant burrow of a wood borer, they enlarge the hole, and, as
their colony is always on the increase, continue to eat away the wood until the
whole trunk is honeycombed. Moreover, they are not accessible to birds generally,
and could pursue their career of destruction unmolested were it not
that the woodpeckers, with beaks and tongues especially fitted for such work,
dig out and devour them. It is thus evident that woodpeckers are great conservators
of forests. To them more than to any other agency we owe the preservation
of timber from hordes of destructive insects.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span>&mdash;Flicker. Length, about 12&frac12; inches.</div>
</div>

<p>One of the larger woodpeckers familiar to everyone is the flicker, or golden-winged
woodpecker<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> (<a href="#fig21">fig. 21</a>), which is generally distributed throughout the
United States from the Atlantic coast to the Rocky Mountains. There it is
replaced by the red-shafted flicker,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> which extends westward to the Pacific.
The two species are as nearly identical
in food habits as their respective
environments will allow. The
flickers, while genuine woodpeckers,
differ somewhat in habits from
the rest of the family, and are frequently
seen searching for food
upon the ground. Like the downy
and hairy woodpeckers, they feed
upon wood-boring grubs and ants,
but the number of ants eaten is
much greater than that eaten by
the other two species. Of the flickers&rsquo;
stomachs examined, three were
completely filled with ants. Two
of these contained more than 3,000
individuals each, while the third
contained fully 5,000. These ants
belong to species which live in the
ground. It is these insects for which
the flicker searches when it runs about in the grass, although some grasshoppers
also are then taken. The flicker&rsquo;s habit of pecking holes in buildings sometimes
greatly annoys its human friends, and it is particularly noticeable in the California
species. Observation has shown that the object of the work is to obtain
shelter for the winter. In the East most of the flickers are migratory, and only a
few remain North where shelter is necessary. These generally find a safe retreat
in the hollow tree In which they nested. In California, however, where the
birds do not migrate, trees are not
so abundant as in the East, and
consequently buildings are brought
into requisition, and in them holes
are drilled, usually under the eaves,
where snug nights&rsquo; lodgings are
found. Often a dozen holes may
be seen in one building. Barns or
other outbuildings are usually selected,
though churches sometimes

<p>The red-headed woodpecker<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> (<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>)
is well known east of the Rocky
Mountains, but Is rather rare in
New England. Unlike some of the
other species, it prefers fence posts
and telegraph poles to trees as
a foraging ground. Its food therefore
naturally differs from that of
the preceding species, and consists
largely of adult beetles and wasps
which it frequently captures on the
wing after the fashion of flycatchers.
Grasshoppers also form an
important part of the food. Among
the beetles are a number of predacious
ground species and some
tiger beetles, which are useful insects. The red-head has been accused
of robbing nests of other birds, and of pecking out the brains of young birds
and poultry; but as the stomachs showed little evidence to substantiate this
charge, the habit probably is exceptional.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_59_59" id="Footnote_59_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_59"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> <i>Melanerpes erythrocephalus</i>.</p></div>

<p>The vegetable food of woodpeckers is varied, but consists largely of small
fruits and berries. The downy and hairy woodpeckers eat such fruits as dogwood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span>
and Virginia creeper and seeds of poison ivy, sumac, and a few other
shrubs. The flicker also eats a great many small fruits and the seeds of a considerable
number of shrubs and weeds. None of the three species is much
given to eating cultivated fruits or crops. The red-head has been accused of
eating the larger kinds of fruit, as apples, and also of taking considerable corn.
Stomach examinations show that to some extent these charges are substantiated,
but that the habit is not prevalent enough to cause much damage. The
bird is fond of mast, especially beechnuts, and when these nuts are plentiful it
remains north all winter.</p>

<p>Woodpeckers apparently are the only agents which can successfully cope with
certain insect enemies of the forest, and, to some extent, with those of fruit
trees also. For this reason, if for no other, they should be protected in every
possible way.</p>

<p>Two species of cuckoos are common In the United States east of the Great
Plains, the yellow-billed cuckoo<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>) and the black-billed cuckoo,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and in
the West a relative of the yellow-bill, the California cuckoo,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> ranges from
Colorado and Texas to the Pacific coast. While the two species are quite distinct,
the food habits of the yellow-bill and the black-bill do not greatly differ
and their economic status is practically the same.</p>

<p>Examination of 155 stomachs has shown that these species are much given
to eating caterpillars, and, unlike most birds, do not reject those covered with
hair. In fact, cuckoos eat so
many hairy caterpillars that the
hairs pierce the inner lining of
the stomach and remain there,
and often when the stomach is
opened it appears to be lined
with a thin coating of fur.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span>&mdash;Yellow-billed cuckoo. Length, about 12 inches.</div>
</div>

<p>An examination of the stomachs
of 46 black-billed cuckoos,
taken during the summer months,
showed the remains of 906 caterpillars,
44 beetles, 96 grasshoppers,
100 sawflies, 30 stinkbugs,
and 15 spiders. In all
probability more individuals
than these were represented, but
their remains were too badly
broken for recognition. Most of
the caterpillars were hairy, and
many of them belong to a genus that lives in colonies and feeds on the leaves of
trees, including the apple tree. One stomach was filled with larvæ of a caterpillar
belonging to the same genus as the tent caterpillar, and possibly to that
species. Other larvæ were those of large moths, for which the bird seems to
have a special fondness. The beetles were for the most part click beetles and
weevils, as well as a few May beetles. The sawflies were contained in two
stomachs, one of which held no less than 60 in the larval stage.</p>

<p>Of the yellow-billed cuckoo, 109 stomachs (collected from May to October)
were examined. They contained 1,865 caterpillars, 93 beetles, 242 grasshoppers,
37 sawflies, 69 bugs, 6 flies, and 86 spiders. As in the case of the black-billed
cuckoo, most of the caterpillars belonged to hairy species and many of them
were of large size. One stomach contained 250 American tent caterpillars;
another 217 fall webworms. The beetles were distributed among several families,
all more or less harmful to agriculture. In the same stomach which contained
the tent caterpillars were 2 Colorado potato beetles; in another were
3 goldsmith beetles, and remains of several other large beetles. Besides the
ordinary grasshoppers were several katydids and tree crickets. The sawflies
were in the larval stage, in which they resemble caterpillars so closely that
they are commonly called false caterpillars by entomologists. The bugs consisted
of stinkbugs and cicadas, or dog-day harvest flies, with the single exception
of one wheel bug, which was the only useful insect eaten.</p>

<p>No bird is better known to country residents than the bobwhite<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> (see illustration
on title-page). The bird&rsquo;s cheery calls the year round form part of
the most pleasant associations of country life, and its neat form and harmonious
coloration, and especially its confiding habits, make it a general
favorite.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_63_63" id="Footnote_63_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> <i>Colinus virginianus.</i></p></div>

<p>Any bushy fence row serves as a retreat for its nest, or for winter shelter, and
weed-covered fields are its favorite feeding places. Weed seeds form more
than half the total food and include those of all the worst weed pests of the
farm. Among them may be mentioned crab, cockspur, witch, and foxtail
grasses, sheep sorrel, smartweed, bindweed, lamb&rsquo;s-quarters, pigweeds, corn
cockle, chickweed, charlock, partridge pea, beggar lice, nail grass, rib grass, ragweed,
and Spanish needles.</p>

<p>Acorns, beechnuts, chestnuts, and pine seeds make up about 2.5 per cent of
the food, and wild fruit about 10 per cent The fruits include berries of palmetto,
smilax, wax myrtle, mulberry, sassafras, blackberries and raspberries,
rose haws, cherry, sumac, grapes, sour gum, blueberries, honeysuckle, partridgeberry,
and a number of others. The bobwhite feeds to a slight extent upon
buds and leaves, including those of yellow and red sorrel, cinquefoil, and
clover.</p>

<p>Grain forms scarcely more than a sixth of the food, and most of it is taken
during winter and early spring when nothing but waste grain is available
The habit of gleaning this after the harvest is beneficial to the farm, for
volunteer grain is not desirable, especially where it serves to maintain certain
insect and fungus pests. Although most of the grain and seed crops grown upon
the farm are represented in bobwhite&rsquo;s dietary, no significant damage can be
attributed to the bird.</p>

<p>Animal food, chiefly insects, composed nearly a sixth of the bird&rsquo;s subsistence.
From June to August, inclusive, when insects are most numerous, their proportion
in the food is about 36 per cent. The variety of insect food is great
and includes a number of the most destructive agricultural pests. Among
them may be mentioned the Colorado potato beetle, 12-spotted cucumber beetle,
bean leaf beetle, squash ladybird, wire-worms. May beetles, corn billbugs,
clover-leaf weevil, army worm, boilworm, cutworms, and chinch bug.</p>

<p>The food habits of the bobwhite undoubtedly are beneficial and the bird
should be maintained in numbers on every farm. This is not to say that all
shooting should be prohibited, for the bird is very prolific. But its numbers
should not be reduced below what the available nesting sites and range will
support. On the other hand the policy of absolute protection recently adopted
by one of the States is not called for by strictly economic considerations.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
